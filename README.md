# 👵 MediGranny – Friendly Medication Guidance Chatbot

MediGranny is a prototype chatbot designed to make **official medication information** accessible to **seniors, caregivers, and non-digital users**.  
Instead of reading complex PDFs or navigating government portals, users can simply “chat” with MediGranny and receive **warm, human-like explanations** about their medicines.

## 🌍 Problem

- The Spanish Medicines Agency (AEMPS) is moving leaflets from **paper to digital only**.  
- Seniors and vulnerable groups risk being **excluded** due to technical barriers.  
- Official PDFs are accurate but full of **medical jargon**.  
- Caregivers often need to translate info into **everyday language**.

MediGranny provides:

- 🗨️ **Plain-language answers** to medication questions.  
- 📚 **Trusted data** sourced from AEMPS / CIMA REST API.  
- ❤️ **Empathetic tone** — designed to feel like talking to a caring person.  
- 🖥️ **Accessible interface** for non-digital natives (simple text, future voice support).  
- 🐳 **Docker-ready** deployment for easy testing anywhere.
